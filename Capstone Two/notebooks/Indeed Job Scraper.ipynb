Region / RemoteReports To: Engineering ManagerReporting to this Position: N/AWHO WE ARE:  Armaments Research Company (ARC) is a startup dedicated to bringing real time situational awareness and battlefield logistics capabilities to both the DoD and law enforcement personnel. You will be an integral part of the ARC team, and will be creating innovative and powerful IoT devices that feed data to the ARC technology stack. Our core offering is an embedded device designed in-house that pushes real time data to the cloud and back down to tactical users on a mobile android device. Our device provides information on firearm discharge, personnel location/status, and rounds of ammunition remaining. The information our device provides enables battlefield/tactical awareness that does not exist today. ARC technologies were initially developed in support of the US Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) and the National Science Foundation (NSF) and leverage internet-of-things (IoT) technology and machine learning (ML) to develop actionable insights and transform security responses.ARCâ€™s core technology gathers data related to key weapon platform outputs which requires a suite of sensors that are transparent to the end user. The ARC products enable aggregated insights over big data sets that will be used to save lives on the frontline. This novel technology will be deployed at scale on future US Military and Law Enforcement weapons to enhance safety, decision making, and transparency for ground personnel.Position Description:  ARC is looking for an enthusiastic, motivated SecDevOps engineer to join our team to automate and secure infrastructure, deployments, and manage a cutting edge architecture including MongoDB, Apache Kafka, Apache Spark, Kubernetes, AWS, ElasticSearch, and many more. You will be independently and collaboratively designing automated solutions to securely administer the ARC tech stack through the use of SALT and GitLab toolchains. As an ARC SecDevOps engineer, you will be responsible for secure administration of cloud environments and have the opportunity to learn new methodologies and best practices from senior engineers and through self-development utilizing ARC resources for training and certifications.Because you will be joining a startup, there are many opportunities to expand beyond your core skills set if desired. You will be part of a high caliber team dedicated to both mission and advancing ground breaking technology. You will have the opportunity to learn and expand your own knowledge base leveraging a highly skilled team of co-workers while working remotely from the Washington DC metro area. Although ARC is a mission-focused startup, you will have the flexibility to utilize an unlimited PTO policy and a proper work/life balance understanding from leadership.Required Experience: Experience administering AWS, Azure, GCP, or other cloud environmentsBasic familiarity with CIDR address blocks, NACLs, Networking/Routing, VPC configurationExperience in software development or DevOps related work administering microservices based architecturesExperience with one or more of the following:Experience with deployment automation using Jenkins, Travis, Github, or GitLab CI/CD processesExperience with Docker or container based infrastructures, either creating dockerized applications or deploying docker containers to ECS/EKS/Kubernetes/Docker Swarm or equivalent.Familiarity with any of the following technologies or equivalents: Apache Kafka, MongoDB, Postgres, Redis, Elastic Stack services, AWS hosted servicesDesired ExperienceBachelorâ€™s or Masterâ€™s degree in Computer Science, Information Systems or similar fieldExpertise in configuring AWS VPC features such as network and security administration, VPC setup, CIDR notation, and firewall/security group/ACL configuration.Expertise in AWS and cloud compute best practices related to DevOpsExperience with message queue systems such as Apache Kafka at scaleExperience managing big data systems and scalability leveraging a variety of scale technologies (K8s, Docker Swarm, Serverless, etc)Physical Demands and Work Environment:  ARC is a fast paced startup, focused on people with attention to avoiding burnout. You will be able to take advantage of an unlimited PTO policy and twelve scheduled holidays in your pursuit of mission success. This position is primarily remote, with the possibility of traveling to the office approximately once a week post-COVID-19 (or more, but we will always have a liberal work from home policy!). You'll be supported by an enthusiastic and friendly team willing to go the extra mile even when you're not physically in the same (home) office space. No clearance is required for this position, but ARC is able to sponsor your own TS clearance (or hold a current one). Work is all unclassified, enabling you to leverage all available commercial tools at your disposal.General Sign-Off:  Individuals with work authorization based on non-immigrant visa status should advise type of visa when submitting resume.
